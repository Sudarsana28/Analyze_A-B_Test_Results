# Analyze_A/B_Test_Results
Our goal is to help an E-Commerce website understand the results of the A/B tests run by them to implement their new web page or keep the old web page or run the experiment longer to make their decision.  

## Stepwise Data Analysis:    
• Working our given data through our Data Wrangling Process of Assessing, Cleaning and making the data ready for Analysis.  
• Using Probability to find out various related proportions from our data.  
• Conducting A/B testing (an experiment design) on two groups of users namely the control and treatment group. Using the statistical technique of Hypothesis Testing to compare the conversion rates (proportion of the users converting to the new web page versus the old web page) between the two groups, by creating the Null and Alternative Hypotheses and performing statistical tests to confirm on accepting one of the Hypotheses.  
• Taking a Regression approach to compare the previously obtained results from the A/B tests carried out in the following steps:
> ▪ Deciding on which model of Regression best suits our data depending on our predicted outcome.  
> ▪ Creating Dummy Variables to represent Categorical data into our Pandas Data frame.  
> ▪ Instantiating and fitting different variables into our Regression models to understand the relationship between the variables on the predictions made.  
> ▪ Understanding the disadvantages on adding additional terms into our Regression models.  
> ▪ Creating interaction variables and using them to fit in our regression models to interpret the results and draw conclusions about the data.
